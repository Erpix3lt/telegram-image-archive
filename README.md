# telegram-web-archive

A **web-based image archive** that uses **Telegram** as storage! This repository contains the project's web app, which allows you to easily retrieve your images, filter and sort them.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Run the telegram bot inside the projects root: 
```bash 
npx tsc bot.ts
node bot.js
```
2. Deploy the image archive to vercel or any other service.
3. Happy archiving!

## ü§ñ ZSH

For ease of execution I wrote a ZSH function allowing to run the bot simply writing `runArchive` in your ZSH console. In order to do so, move your archive into the documents folder on mac, or simply costumise the path.

## üåü Minimal Styling

The web app has been designed with a minimalist approach, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience on both **desktop** and **mobile** devices.
